> Bypass Threads SSL certificate pinning on Android to intercept, inspect, and analyze HTTPS network traffic — works on both **rooted** and **non-rooted** devices.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project provides a pre-patched **Threads APK** with SSL/TLS certificate pinning disabled, allowing security researchers and developers to capture and analyze Threads HTTPS traffic using standard MITM proxy tools.

**Key highlights:**

- ✅ No root required (also supports rooted devices)
- ✅ Compatible with Android emulators (Nox, LDPlayer)
- ✅ Works with popular proxy tools (Burp Suite, Mitmproxy, Reqable, Proxypin)
- ✅ ARM64-v8a & x86_64 architecture support

## 📱 Requirements

### Option A: Physical Android Device

- Android phone or tablet (**rooted or non-rooted**)
- A traffic interception proxy tool:
  - [Proxypin](https://proxypin.com) — free, lightweight
  - [Reqable](https://reqable.com) — feature-rich, modern UI

### Option B: Android Emulator (PC)

- Windows PC with one of the following emulators installed:
  - [Nox Player](https://www.bignox.com/)
  - [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/)
- A desktop MITM proxy tool:
  - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) — industry standard
  - [Mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) — open source
  - [Reqable](https://reqable.com)
  - [Proxypin](https://proxypin.com)

## 🚀 Bypass Procedure

1. **Download** the SSL pinning bypassed Threads APK from this repository.
2. **Install** the patched APK on your Android device or emulator.
3. **Configure** your proxy tool of choice (Proxypin, Reqable, Burp Suite, or Mitmproxy) to intercept traffic.
4. **Launch Threads** and start capturing HTTPS requests and responses.

> **Tip:** Make sure to install and trust the proxy's CA certificate on your device for full HTTPS decryption.

## 🔑 How It Works

The SSL/TLS certificate pinning mechanism in Threads validates server certificates against a set of embedded pins at the native library level. This bypass patches the certificate verification logic in the compiled ARM64/x86_64 binary, causing the pinning check to always succeed — allowing proxy tools with custom CA certificates to intercept traffic seamlessly.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this require root access?**
A: No. The patched APK works on both rooted and non-rooted Android devices.

**Q: Will this work on iOS?**
A: No. This bypass targets the Android version of Threads only.

**Q: Can I use this with Burp Suite?**
A: Yes. Configure Burp Suite as a proxy, install the Burp CA certificate on your device/emulator, and launch the patched Threads app.

**Q: The patched version doesn't match the latest Threads release — what do I do?**
A: [Contact me on Telegram](https://t.me/MUH4MM4DSH4KIB) for the latest bypassed build.
